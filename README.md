# tic-tac-toe
I coded a simple tic tac toe game at the top you can choose to switch between playing singleplayer against an ai or play with a friend in the multiplayer.
To play all you have to do is click pretty simple and easy just how it should be.
For fun each time that you click to play you will hear a little boing sound, if you win on the multiplayer you will hear a cash_register chime sound.
